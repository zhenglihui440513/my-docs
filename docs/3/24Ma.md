随着大量分布式能源以及电动汽车、灵活负载（FL）等新型负载的出现，为产消者的能源管理带来了新的应对方式。

> With the emergence of a large number of DERs and new loads such as, EV, and flexible load (FL), it brings a new response way to the energy management of prosumers.

储能（ES）可以通过及时充放电平衡产消者的能源需求[4]，FL可以通过需求响应调整负荷需求[5]、[6]，电动汽车利用V2G机制实现与电网的双向能量交换，有利于电动汽车的发展和削峰填谷[7]。

> Energy storage (ES) can balance the energy demand of prosumers through timely charging and discharging [4], FL can adjust the load demand through demand response [5], [6], and EVs use the V2G mechanism to achieve two-way energy exchange with the power grid, which is conducive to the development of EVs and peak cutting and valley filling [7]. 

鉴于电池储能系统（ESS）的优势，文献[8]构建了考虑PV和ESS的能源管理系统，目标是最小化生产成本。 ES的充放电行为用于提高系统的效益。

> In view of the benefits of battery energy storage systems (ESSs), an energy management system was built in [8] that considers PV and ESSs, with the goal of minimizing production costs. The charge and discharge behavior of ES is used to improve the benefits of the system.

文献[9]提出了能源区级需求响应策略，根据市场情况动态确定能源价格，以获得最佳能源管理策略。

> Reference [9] proposed an energy district-level demand response strategy, in which energy prices were dynamically determined according to market conditions to obtain the best energy management strategy. 

文献[10]设计了一种策略，有效利用电动汽车电池容量来减轻太阳能光伏影响和电网支持，并开发了可控充放电模式，有效利用电动汽车充放电来减轻不确定性的影响。

> A strategy was designed in [10] to effectively utilize EV battery capacity to mitigate solar PV impact and grid support, and developed a controllable charging/discharging mode to effectively utilize EV charging and discharging to mitigate the impact of uncertainties.

文献[11]提出了一种基于区块链的V2G网络能源交易方案，可以有效提高能源交换效率并降低通信成本。

> A blockchain-based V2G network energy transaction scheme was proposed in [11], which could effectively improve energy exchange efficiency and reduced communication costs.

上述文献针对产消者内部能源管理提出了不同的操作策略，但没有考虑产消者之间在分销系统层面的交易。

>  The above reference proposed different operational strategies for the internal energy management of prosumers but did not consider the transaction among prosumers at the level of distribution system.

 

# P2P 介绍

P2P交易市场非常适合去中心化和自治的能源交易[12]。 P2P能源市场可以组织小规模能源所有者之间的大量交易[13]，有效促进DER的本地消费[14]，[15]。

> The P2P transaction market is well-suited for decentralized and autonomous energy transaction [12]. P2P energy markets can organize a large number of transactions among small-scale energy owners [13], effectively promoting the local consumption of DER [14], [15].

 

# Clearing介绍/好方法必要性

许多研究的重点是解决将产消者的供需出价与个性化偏好或兴趣相匹配的挑战[16]。它通常被称为市场出清机制，是P2P能源交易的基本原理[17]。

> Many studies are focused on addressing the challenge of matching supply and demand bids from prosumers with personalized preferences or interests [16]. It is commonly referred to as the market clearing mechanism, which serves as the fundamental principle of P2P energy transactions [17]. However, the existing research and discussions on that mechanism are diverse and extensive.

然而，分布式算法和博弈论在解决小规模调度和交易时的收敛性和速度并不理想。在以产消者为中心的市场中，建立合理的交易机制有利于实现产消者的自主运作，具有良好的收敛性能和速度，可以快速、准确地实现双端P2P交易。

> However, the convergence and speed of distributed algorithms and game theory are not ideal when solving small-scale scheduling and trading. In prosumer-centered markets, establishing a reasonable transaction mechanism is conducive to realizing prosumers’ autonomous operation, with good convergence performance and speed, allowing for the quick and accurate realization of double-end P2P trading.

# NUC的引入

在以产消者为中心的市场中，产消者使用分配系统进行能源交易，因此需要在交易过程中考虑网络约束。

> In a prosumer-centered market, prosumers trade energy using distribution systems, necessitating consideration of network constraints during transactions.

文献[24]提出了一种新颖的集成交易和操作模型，在保证分发系统安全约束的同时实现P2P交易。 Vickrey-Clarke-Groves机制用于解决P2P交易中产消者利益与分销系统运行要求之间的冲突。

> Reference [24] proposed a novel integrated transaction and operation model to realize P2P transactions while ensuring distribution system security constraints. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism was used to resolve conflicts between prosumer interests in P2P transactions and distribution system operational requirements.

然而，由于产消者在经济上独立，网络约束被纳入网络收费中[25]，通过经济手段纠正P2P交易结果以确保合规性[26]。

> However, as prosumers are economically independent, network constraints are integrated into network charges [25], with P2P transaction results corrected through economic means to ensure compliance [26].

 

# Dlmp方法缺陷

然而，基于DLMP的策略仅解决短期运营成本，而没有考虑系统的时空动态和节点敏感性。

> However, the strategy based on DLMP only addresses short-term operating costs without considering the temporal and spatial dynamics of the system and node sensitivity. Additionally, the distance strategy fails to account for the network investment costs and transmission loss costs of distribution system operator (DSO).

 

## 内部DR与P2P交易配合

在这种模式下，产消者最初通过最小化不平衡能源来响应需求。只有当需求响应达到上限时，产消者才会参与能源市场交易。

> Under this model, prosumers initially responded to the demand by minimizing the unbalanced energy. Only when the demand response reaches the upper limit do the prosumers engage in energy market trading.
